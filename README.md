## Return of Agalon

A simple, top-down 2D action role-playing game where a fearless
adventurer braves dungeons teeming with fierce enemies in search
of loot.

Dungeons are procedurally generated using cellular automata. Chests with loot hide in corners and down pathways guarded by enemies. Explore the dungeons and find new weapons and potions that you can trade at the shop.
